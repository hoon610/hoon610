My name is Hoon ðŸ˜ƒ. I was born in South Korea, and raised in Arizona ðŸŒµðŸŒµ

I am currently living in the Boston area, finishing up my Masters Degree.

I love solving problems and have been coding throughout my undergrad work to manage, sort, and analyze large datasets. I am currently looking for employment in software engineering or data science. 

Check out my [website](https://hoonkang.net) where I have old projects as well as some new ones I have been doing in order to transition my coding skills from academia into the workforce!
